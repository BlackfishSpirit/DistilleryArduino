How to use the scale:

Initially, you'll need to calibrate the scale with ScaleCalibration.ino. 
With this program, you can determine a number with which to tweak the output values to something reasonable.
Different scales will need to be calibrated individually.
Once you determine a value, you'll use it as the calibration_factor in the ScaleBuzzer.ino.

ScaleBuzzer.ino is set up specifically for an Arduino Uno
  -other Arduino types will need to be adjusted regarding pin numbers on hardware and in code
    -I'll try to add a diagram soon

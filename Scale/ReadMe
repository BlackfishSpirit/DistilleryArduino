How to use the scale:

Initially, you'll need to calibrate the scale with ScaleCalibration.ino. 
The calibration_factor value can be adjust by inputting into the Serial Monitor in the Arduino IDE
To use it, you'll need an Arduino with a scale attached, a weight of known mass, and a computer
With the Arduino connected to the computer and running, 
Place the object of known mass on the scale.
Type a or + to adjust calibration_factor up,
or z or - to adjust calibration_factor down
When the value outputted to the monitor is equal to the known mass of the object on the scale, make note of the calibration_factor value.
Different scales will need to be calibrated individually.
Once you determine a value, you'll use it as the calibration_factor in the ScaleBuzzer.ino.

ScaleBuzzer.ino is set up specifically for an Arduino Uno
  -other Arduino types will need to be adjusted regarding pin numbers on hardware and in code
    -I'll try to add a diagram soon
